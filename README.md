MLH New Hack New Year Hackathon Repo

Hi and welcome to the HackerGames 

HackerGames is a minipack of games similar to Jackbox. From 1 friend to 100, you 
can bond with folks over this game. 

# Installing and Running the App Info!
To be able to play hangman, you need to install randomwords. In your terminal,
type: pip install RandomWords

Once it's installed, hangman will work. 

TO RUN THIS PROJECT: application.py is the main file that you will run to access
the games as a whole package/project! You do need to have cmu-112-graphics.py in 
the same folder level though. 

Included in this application are 5 games:
1. Snake
    - AI mode (singleplayer)
    - Multiplayer Mode
2. War
    - A singleplayer terminal game for those who laptops and computers can't
    handle running intense graphics
3. Pong
    - Multiplayer (play with 1 friend)
4. Hangman
    - A single player graphics game where the computer comes up with a word and 
    you have to try to guess it! 

Connection to New Year Theme: 
    It's finally 2021!!!! After the brutal year that was 2020, we are all 
    excited to turn over a new leaf and go back to normal. But... even if we
    want to pretend like 2020 is behind us, we need to remember that we are 
    still in the middle of a pandemic. A sobering though in this time of fresh
    starts, but important nonetheless. We still have to social distance, but
    social distancing doesn't mean we have to be isolated from our friends! Our 
    application is a whole host of party games that lets you play with multiple
    people (or if they're all busy then you can play against the AI)
